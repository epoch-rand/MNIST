#### MNIST Handwriting Classification
Abstract: *The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. Although state-of-the-art models have effectively solved the problem, the dataset itself remains useful to the research community, providing a simple sanity check for new methods: if it doesn't work on MNIST, it doesn't work anywhere.*

### Packages

`os` `numpy` `tensorflow2.x`

### Requirements

- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation. We recommend Anaconda3 with numpy 1.19.1 or newer.
