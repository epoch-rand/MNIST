#### MNIST Handwriting Classification Tool - Tensorflow 2.x
Abstract: *The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning. Although the dataset is effectively solved, it can be used as the basis for learning and practicing how to develop, evaluate, and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification.*

### Packages

`os` `numpy` `matplotlib` `tensorflow2`

### Requirements

- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation. We recommend Anaconda3 with numpy 1.19.1 or newer.
